## Elm SSR experiment

This is a Elm ssr experiment, it uses Razzle to server the http responses.
`razzle.config.js` is the equivalent to `webpack.config.js`

### This repository still wip, I need to fix some issues with Elm webpack loader isn't working correctly with Razzle webpack...

## To run: 

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Libraries used:

- [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle)
- [Elm Static Html](https://github.com/eeue56/elm-static-html-lib) (To convert Elm views into html format)
