## Elm SSR

This is a Elm ssr example, it uses Razzle (Express) to server the http responses, also has hot code reloading!

`razzle.config.js` is the equivalent to `webpack.config.js`

## To run: 

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Libraries used:

- [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle)
- [Elm Static Html](https://github.com/eeue56/elm-static-html-lib) (To convert Elm views into html format)
